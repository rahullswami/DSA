# What is Tree?
>> A Tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to child nodes,with one node serving as the root from which all nodes are accessible.

# Tree Terminologies 
>> Root Node : Here 'A' is the 'root' node
In any tree the first node is called as root node

>> Edge Node : In any tree, 'Edge' is a connecting link between two nodes.

>> Parent Node : Here A,B,C,E,& G are Parent nodes
In any tree the node which has child/children is called 'Parent'
A node which is predecessor of any other node is called 'Parent'

>> Child Node : Here B & C are children of A 
                Here G & H are children of C 
                Here K is child of G

                descendant of any node is called as child node

>> Sibling Nodes :  Here B & C are Sibling
                    Here D E & F are Sibling
                    Here G & H are Sibling
                    Here I & J are Sibling

                    In any tree the nodes which has same Parent are called 'Sibling'
                    The children of a Parent are called 'Sibling'

>> Leaf Nodes : Here D,I,J,F,K,H are Leaf Nodes

                In any tree the node which does not have children is called 'Leaf'
                A node without successors is called a 'Leaf' node

>> Degree of a Node :   Here Degree of B is 3
                        Here Degree of A is 2
                        Here Degree of F is 0
                        
                        In any tree 'Degree' of a node is total number of children it has.

>> Height : In any tree ,'Heightof node' is total number of Edge from leaf to that node in longest path.
In any tree ,'Height of tree' is the Height of the root node.
